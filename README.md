## Repository Structure

The main folder, ``Analyses``, contains all the preprocessing, regression, prediction, validation, and library scripts. 

Within the `Analyses` folder:

- The `preprocessing` contains scripts for homogenizing the velocity data for regression.
- The `regression` holds scripts for running both the stationary and spatially varying regression models, as well as for performing semivariogram analysis.
- The `implementation` includes scripts for evaluating the velocity models.
- The `site_response` contains files for generating velocity profiles and conducting the site response analysis.

The main `Data` folder mirrors the structure of the `Analyses` folder and includes all the corresponding input and output files.

The ``Raw_files`` includes project files in raw format.
